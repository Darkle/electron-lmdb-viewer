Will i need to convert things to messagepack/cbor etc when edit/add??
When add mention the current encoding (messagepack/cbor etc).

If they wanted to search binary, would they want to search by hex or would we assume its text in binary form and use TextDecoder? I guess could add a checkbox or summin to the search.
